"""Sound Event model.

Sound events are the heart of the app, as they are the primary objects
of annotation. A sound event is any distinguishable sound within a
recording that is of interest to users. The app allows users to
efficiently find and annotate relevant sound events, which can then be
used to generate machine learning models for automatic detection.

A recording can have multiple sound events, or none at all. To annotate
a sound event, the user marks the region within the spectrogram to which
it is confined. There are several ways to mark the region, such as by
indicating the timestamp for the onset of the sound event, indicating
when the sound event starts and stops, or providing very detailed
information about which time and frequency regions belong to the sound
event.

Each annotation has a type, depending on the geometry type of the mark,
such as point, line, or rectangle. The geometry of the mark itself is
also recorded, allowing for detailed information about the sound event
to be stored. For example, if the annotation is a rectangle, information
about the frequency range and duration of the sound event can be
recorded.

The app also allows for the addition of tags to sound events, providing
additional information about the sound event. Tags can include
information such as the species that emitted the sound, the behavior the
emitter was displaying, or the syllable type of the sound. By annotating
a sufficiently large and diverse set of sound events, the app can help
users efficiently generate machine learning models that can detect these
events automatically.
