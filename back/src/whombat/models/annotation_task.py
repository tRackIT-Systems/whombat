"""Annotation Task.

A task is the fundamental unit of annotation work within a project. Each
task represents a specific piece of audio that needs to be annotated
according to the project's criteria. For example, a task could involve
identifying all the vocalizations produced by a certain bird species in
a particular recording, or adding a specific tag to a short audio clip.

Once a task has been assigned to an annotator, they are responsible for
completing the annotation work required by the project criteria. This
may involve listening to the audio clip multiple times, identifying and
labeling specific sound events or audio features, and ensuring that the
annotations are accurate and consistent with the project goals.

Once an annotator has completed a task, they can mark it as finished in
the app. Other users can then review the completed task and add notes or
comments to provide context or raise issues with the existing
annotations. This collaborative approach helps to ensure that the
annotations are of high quality and that any errors or inconsistencies
are identified and corrected in a timely manner.
