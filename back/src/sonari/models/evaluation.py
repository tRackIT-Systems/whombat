"""Evaluation model.

An Evaluation can be conducted on a Prediction Run to get information
about the performance of the ML model. Evaluation is only possible on
processed clips that have also been completely annotated. If there are
any fully annotated clips that have also been processed by the model, we
can ground truth the model predictions against the user annotations.
Users can restrict the tags that will be evaluated, and also select
whether evaluation will be done at the clip level, at the sound event
level, or both.

Evaluation at the clip level means evaluating the predicted clip tags
against the true tags of the clip provided by the annotators. Each
processed clip's predicted tags will be compared against the annotated
clip tags, and a score will be provided depending on the amount of
correct tags predicted.

At the sound event level, each predicted sound event will be matched
with annotated sound events using an affinity metric, and their
predicted tags will be checked against the true sound event tags. Users
can configure some evaluation parameters, such as how to match sound
events.
