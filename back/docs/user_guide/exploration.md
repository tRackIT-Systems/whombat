# Data Exploration

Sonari provides diverse tools for exploring the data you've meticulously worked
on. Below, we'll introduce three key exploration avenues:

1. Recordings
2. Audio Clips
3. Sound Events

To access the exploration section, click on the "Exploration" button on the
sidebar or utilize the navigation cards on the home page. Once in the
exploration section, choose your preferred exploration type.

## Recordings

Explore and search through all the recordings registered in Sonari. Utilize the
search bar or filters to narrow down the displayed recordings. A list of
recording spectrograms is presented for swift browsing.

## Audio Clip

In the Audio Clips section, spectrograms are showcased in a Gallery view,
allowing simultaneous viewing of multiple clips. Employ filtering tools to
choose specific clips for examination.

## Sound Events

Navigate individual sound events in this section, opting for either the Gallery
view or the Scatter Plot view. The gallery displays each sound event's
spectrogram, while the scatterplot provides a 3D representation. Each dot
represents a sound event, with coordinates based on three acoustic
featuresâ€”defaulting to duration, bandwidth, and lowest frequency. Click on a
point in the scatterplot to view the corresponding spectrogram of the sound
event.

## Conclusion

Our commitment to enhancing exploration tools will offer you even greater
insights into your data. Stay tuned for updates!
