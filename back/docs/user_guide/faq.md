# FAQ

## 1. I'm having trouble logging in. What should I do?

If you're logging into Sonari for the first time, you might not have a
personalized username and password yet. Don't worry, Sonari automatically sets
up a default user during initialization.

To get started:

- Username: **admin**
- Password: **admin**

After your initial login, head over to your user profile to customize both your
username and password to something more personalized and secure.

## 2. What is the AOEF format?

The AOEF format is a custom data format designed for integration with Sonari
data. It is outlined in the `soundevent` package, and for a more in-depth
understanding, we suggest checking out their
[documentation](https://mbsantiago.github.io/soundevent/). In simple terms, it's
a [JSON](https://www.json.org)-based format, drawing heavy inspiration from the
[COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) format.

*[AOEF]: Acoustic Object Exchange Format
