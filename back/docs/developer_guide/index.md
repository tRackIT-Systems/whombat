# Developer Guide

Welcome to the Sonari Developer Guide. This comprehensive resource covers a
variety of topics essential for developers:

1. [Quickstart](quickstart.md): Learn how to set up a development environment on
   your machine quickly.
2. [Architecture](architecture.md): Gain insight into the high-level structure
   of Sonari, its main components, and how they come together to form the final
   application.
3. [Database Layer](database.md): Explore information about the data stored by
   Sonari, its storage configuration, and ways to tailor it to meet specific
   requirements.
4. [Python API](api.md): Discover the convenient Python API provided by Sonari

   is constructed.
